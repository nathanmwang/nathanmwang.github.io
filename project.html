						<h6>Client</h6>
						<h2>Techweek</h2>
						<p>
							Techweek hosts a 7-day series of events with a 2-day technology conference and expo to bring together a mixture of entrepreneurs, visionaries, and thought leaders. This weeklong celebration of technology and innovation brings the local community together and Techweek shines a global spotlight on those exciting developments

						<h6>The Problem</h6>
						<p>
							After creating a competitive analysis, my team found that there was a multitude of conference websites that provided mixed results. Some sites displayed their events in a format that was easily viewable while others contained too much information. The client's main focus was to create a responsive website and have the overall layout be more festive and interactive by displaying vibrant colors, modern typography, and utilizing whitespace and limited the amount of content on a page.
						</p>

						<h6>The Challenge</h6>
						<p>
							Design an overall system that helps users discover, plan, and RSVP to the events of techweek at ease.
						</p>
						<p>
							Provide a sense of time and space and make it easy to discover available and preferable events. Present a simple way to create a short list for review and allow users to choose viewing format and provide an easy way to coordinate schedules with others.

					<h6>Wireframes</h6>
					<p>
						The UX team conducted research and executed a prototype for both the desktop site and mobile app. The main focus of the desktop prototype was to have event information readily available to users and to avoid content overload (event descriptions should be displayed after clicking.)
						<br><br>
						The main focus of the mobile app prototype was the ability to check into an event, and overall make the app conducive for navigating to Techweek events.

					<h6>Home Page</h6>
					<p>
						The home page serves two purposes: the first is to show users the many cities where Techweek holds their conferences. Viewers will be able to use the carasol to scroll and view the difference cities and also purchase tickets. The second is introduce various major events that a Techweek conference offers and viewers have the option to attend or be a sponsor to vthat specific event.

					<h6>City Page</h6>
					<p>
						A large amount of work was put into redesigning Techweek's existing city page. The ability to choose between the conference's schedule overview, the specific city's event schedule, the speakers, and the user's saved events has been completely restructured to provide an easier way to switch between content and create a pleasant user experience.

					<h6>Find A Coach Page</h6>
					<p>
						My team was in charge of designing the registration phase of searching for a coach. Two pages were created, the first being a general information's input form and a search questionnaire. These pages were created in order to better match coaches with clients based off background info and preference.

					<h6>The Problem</h6>
					<p>
						Users seeking online learning are not gaining the necessary set of skills and knowledge to apply what they have learned to real-life situations. They need comprehensive lessons and projects avalable in one platform and feedback from professionals in those industries.
					</p>

					<h6>The Challenge</h6>
					<p>
						My team was challenged with the task to reimagine and redesign the online learning experience.

					<h6>Wireframes</h6>
					<p>
						The UX designer on my team created a low fidelity wireframe that focused on starting a course in Fron-End Development. The user finishes the first lesson in that course, receving a project assignment, and completing and submitting that project. From this iteration process, I began brainstorming the platforms branding style and began executing screens.

					<h6>Home Page</h6>
					<p>
						One of the most important sceens is our landing page. The home page is the first page that interested users will see so I wanted to evoke excitement in learning by using powerful imagery and a vibrant color scheme. One of the main purposes of the home page is showing users the paths (courses) that Elevate offers and I used color blocking to separate these sections and including prominent call-to-action buttons.

						</div>

					<h6>Course Dashboard</h6>
					<p>
						The course dashboard is the page where users can dive in and explore view the individual lessons within the chosen course. Some of these lessons include videos, challenges, quizzes, and a final project. To avoid having the entire page be too text heavy, I created custom icons to distinguish the type of lesson and have the page be more visual.

					<h6>Projects Page</h6>
					<p>
						One of the aspects that differentiates Elevate with other online platforms is peer-to-peer mentoring. During the final projects stage, users have the option to submit their project for review to a professional. They leave feedback in the user's code and students can use those comments to improve their the project. Having this new option helps user's avoid making the same mistake again and helps them retain information.

					<h6>Profile Page</h6>
					<p>
						The profile page is where users can see and keep track of what courses they are currently enrolled in and what they have completed. The projects view is where users can see what projects are currently being reviewed by mentors. The playground view is a personal code editor that the user can show off their latest creations and build test cases.

					<h6>Project</h6>
					<h2>Local Guide</h2>
					<p>
						Local Guide is a mobile travel app that provides information and recommendations regarding a particular area that a user is in or will be traveling to.
						The app's main feature is the ability to search and explore various establishments in a nearby area. There is additional functionality to look specifically at nearby hotels and restaurants and see reviews.

					<h6>The Problem</h6>
					<p>
						There has been an increase of travelers who not only want visit tourist attrations, but also want to create their own unique experience, whether it be for individuals traveling or when traveling with friends and family. Everyone has their own particular wants and needs, and they should not be generalized into one single traveler category.
					</p>

					<h6>User Personas</h6>
					<p>
						After reading and analyzing a a provided transcript of interviews on eight different types of travelers, I created two user personas in order to find our target audience. Wanting to focus on business travelers and casual vacations, Kelly and Adam embody these two personas; Kelly being the spontaneous traveler and Adam being the structured, pre-planning individual.

					<h6>Prototype</h6>
					<p>
						After paper prototyping, I began creating lo-fidelity wireframes using Axure. The flow that I designed was for a user that was traveling on a business meeting and is using Local Guide to search for a hotel. Prototyping allowed for quick iterations and the ability to user test the app's functionality.
